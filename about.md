# About Me
Hello I am Bewu I like reading, playing games, and cats. I am okay at coding and I plan to get better at it over the year. I also plan on being a veterinarian in the future if I can survive my ap bio class this year. My favorite Novel is Shadow Slave and I even named my cat after the mc. My name is Bewu after an old friend started calling me that and it stuck, as of why Bewu of all names I haven't a clue... I want to become a Veterinarian because I love animals and I want to make a lot of money TwT. Some skills I will learn in this course that will help me in working as a vet are, working and collaborating as a team, and managing stress.
