# About Me
Hello! I am Bewu.
Hello I am Bewu I like reading, playing games, and cats. I am okay at coding and I plan to get better at it over the year. I also plan on being a veterinarian in the future if I can survive my ap bio class this year. My favorite Novel is Shadow Slave and i even named my cat after the mc. My name is bewu after an old friend started calling me that and it stuck, as of why bewu of all names i haven't a clue... I want to become a Veterinarian because I love animals and I make a lot of money. Some skills I will learn in this course that will help me in working as a vet are, working and collaborating as a team, and managing stress.
